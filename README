This is my vim configuration: .vim for Unix, vimfiles for Windows.
The purpose of this repository is to make setting up vim on new computers 
(esp. vitual machines) easier.

Setup (Linux):
- Install git and vim
- Clone the repository into the .vim directory:
    git clone https://github.com/Solumin/solumin.vim.git ~/.vim
- Create a symlink to ~/.vimrc from the cloned .vimrc:
    ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.vim/.vimrc

Setup (Windows):
- Install Github for Windows and GVim
- Clone the repository into the main Github folder
- Create a folder link to the whole folder:
    mklink /J C:\Users\<username>\vimfiles path-to-repo
- Create a link to the .vimrc:
    mlink /D C:\Users\<username>\.vimrc path-to-repo\.vimrc

I'm using pathogen as my plugin manager, because Vundle seems to be a little
more than I need at the moment.

TODO:
- Add .bat file for installing on Windows
- Add .sh file for installing on Linux
